# FoodFlow Project Roadmap

## Current objective

Finish Batch 4 as one verified production line: complete code and mobile parity, pass every local/remote gate, deploy Supabase + Railway + Vercel, verify production behavior, and publish immutable Docker artifacts from the verified `master` head.

Status on 2026-07-13: **integration is incorporated in `master`; hardening is in progress; no-go for production**.

## Completed and incorporated work

- Controlled consolidation of available backend, Admin, Restaurant, mobile, AI, realtime, map/tracking, docs, and DevOps work.
- Remote and local branch cleanup is complete: only `master` remains, and no linked integration worktree remains. Do not recreate historical integration branches.
- Admin/Restaurant runtime API-envelope validation and removal of fake empty/zero business fallbacks across critical screens.
- Restaurant URL-authoritative vi/en/ja locale isolation and accessibility contrast/focus fixes.
- Backend Supabase Realtime outbox/RLS token contract, Supabase Storage adapter, and PostgreSQL job outbox/Cron endpoint.
- Admin and Restaurant Supabase Realtime client support with explicit provider selection.
- DeepSeek `deepseek-v4-flash` provider adapter, persisted session/usage telemetry, fail-closed provider errors, and Admin monitor contract.
- Shipper GPS freshness, route-phase geometry, provider ETA/progress, tracking authorization, and hardcoded map fallback removal.
- Node 22.13+/pnpm 11.11 alignment and frozen-install paths.
- Multi-architecture non-root Backend/Migrate/Admin/Restaurant images and fail-closed Docker release promotion.
- Screenshot/GIF capture tooling and rewritten architecture/deployment/testing documentation. Existing media is historical until recaptured with source/runtime references.
- Admin URL locale ownership, localized overview KPI labels, and accessible color tokens. The related vi/en/ja browser and axe record is historical and needs a fresh final-head rerun.
- Mobile managed realtime parity through scoped Supabase token/channel authorization, receive-only outbox subscriptions, authenticated REST GPS/dispatch decisions, and explicit Socket.IO local compatibility.
- Private driver KYC storage, owner-scoped upload grants, image metadata/signature checks, one-pending enforcement, signed Admin review, typed mobile onboarding, and vi/en/ja UI/tests.

## In progress before release

### UI, UX, i18n, and media

- Audit every Admin/Restaurant critical page in fresh `vi`, `en`, and `ja` contexts for title, `html lang`, visible text, aria text, number/date/currency formatting, and cookie isolation.
- Complete responsive/keyboard/axe review for dashboard, approval, promotion, audit/export, staff, benchmark, AI monitor, map, and order flows.
- Compare implementation with approved Stitch/design artifacts and establish accepted visual regression evidence.
- Recapture product media only after the intended source is built and seeded; record source commit, Compose/image references, and whether the run used a clean final head or a dirty workspace.

### Mobile release validation

- Reconcile mobile work only from verifiable branches, commits, and patch evidence; do not name, recreate, or infer missing refs.
- Re-run generated API model/contract alignment, vi/en/ja, customer/driver flows, maps/GPS, offline/reconnect, scoped realtime denial, KYC, and signed release builds.
- Validate Android production signing and iOS build/signing on an authorized macOS runner; a local debug keystore is compile evidence only.

### Backend and production topology

- Audit remaining production Redis dependency and document/provision it explicitly or remove it safely; do not leave an accidental Vercel runtime dependency.
- Validate every migration in the final source head against a fresh PostGIS database and the target Supabase project; do not rely on an old fixed migration count.
- Verify RLS/publication/storage policies and cross-tenant realtime denial against Supabase, not only unit tests.
- Run live DeepSeek, Google routing, SePay, notification, export, storage, and secured Cron smoke with rotated secrets.
- Review mutable third-party Compose image tags and pin release-relevant dependencies.

### Testing and security

- Fresh backend Prisma/typecheck/lint/full Jest/build.
- Fresh web frozen install/typecheck/ESLint/full Vitest/build.
- Full Playwright Chromium + Firefox and critical-page axe serious/critical = 0.
- Accepted visual/Stitch regression and tenant isolation.
- Flutter frozen dependency fetch, analyze, full tests, and customer/driver release builds at the final source head.
- Full repo/staged secret scan, Gitleaks, CodeQL, dependency audit, Trivy, SBOM, actionlint, ShellCheck.

## External blockers

- GitHub Actions billing/auth/token access is exhausted; fresh current-head remote workflows cannot yet approve release.
- Supabase is linked and has 32 migrations, private Broadcast authorization, split Storage buckets, Data API disabled, and the FoodFlow ES256 signing key active. Production business/RAG tables are intentionally empty until real onboarding/import.
- Railway API/worker/migrator have database, Supabase, Redis, and ES256 realtime values but still lack real Maps/routing, DeepSeek, SePay, SMTP, FCM service-account, Twilio, and webhook credentials. Live controlled-token FCM delivery is still required.
- Admin and Restaurant Vercel production env now use the Railway API URL and current Supabase publishable key; they must be redeployed only after the API is live.
- Any previously pasted DeepSeek/provider key must be rotated before live smoke.

These are release blockers, not permission to add fake values or bypass validation.

## Release sequence after completion

1. Freeze the final source head and run the full local gate.
2. Restore and pass every required GitHub workflow on that head.
3. Enter rotated secrets through secure prompts/dashboard and pass Supabase/Vercel preflight.
4. Deploy Supabase migrations, RLS, explicit Realtime publication, and Storage policies.
5. Deploy Railway migrator, then API/worker; verify health/readiness/Cron.
6. Build/deploy Admin and Restaurant against the verified API alias.
7. Run production health plus authenticated realtime/map/chatbot/export/payment/notification/tenant smoke.
8. Verify the deployed commit remains the intended `origin/master` head; do not recreate or push historical integration branches.
9. Publish Docker SHA manifests, immutable `v4.0.0`, then manually promote `latest` after smoke.
10. Update final release report, registry digests, GitHub About/topics/homepage, and landing notes.

## Post-release

- Monitor API/web health, Cron backlog, realtime delivery, AI cost/error rate, map provider failures, storage, and payments.
- Validate mobile production signing and staged rollout after the web/API production line is healthy.
- Define retention/cleanup for realtime/job outboxes and AI telemetry.
- Close/remove superseded Docker Hub worker tags only after backup and consumer audit.
- Preserve the one-branch policy and do not recreate historical integration worktrees or refs.

## Deferred by design

- Kubernetes/microservice extraction until measured scale requires it.
- Unsupported Parquet export until a real writer/storage lifecycle exists.
- Broad public Supabase channels or RLS bypasses.
- Recreating unavailable historical branches.
- Deploying from local-only evidence while remote CI is unavailable.
